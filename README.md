- __**Immersive**__ Engineering is a realism-inspired technology mod.
- Decorate your house with __**Macaw's**__ doors, windows, lights, lamps, furniture, fences, and walls.
- __**Farmer's Delight**__ and many of its add-ons gently expand upon farming and cooking.
- Some light exploration is available with __**When Dungeons Arise**__ and __**Biomes O'Plenty**__ mods.
- Tetra for the combat and some light exploration.
- __**Botania**__ and __**Ars Nouveau**__ for magic.
- A lot more blocks and items to use and build with.


The pack contains some optimization mods, Rubidium and Oculus as well, therefore the use of shaders is already available.

We do not own any of the mods in this pack.
